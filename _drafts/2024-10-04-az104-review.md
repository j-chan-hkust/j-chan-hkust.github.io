### Preramble
After a long hiatus from studying for certifications (more than 2 years), company pressure finally pushed my off my butt to obtain the Azure Admin Associate (AZ-104) exam. 

I just passed the AZ-104 exam on Sep 30th, 2024 after 2 weeks of procrastination and 2 weeks of studying(cramming). While I wouldn't say my preparation was perfect (and nor was my score ha), I did learn a lot about Azure, networking, and studying.

 Part of the the reason I decided to write this article was I didn't like any of the reviews I could find on [Kagi](https://kagi.com/), so I decided it would be worth writing my own.
### My background
I've worked with AWS for 2-3 years, mostly doing SysAdmin work for large teams. Over this time, I've dabbled with Azure administration enough to do basic administration on the platform, managing users, departments, and subscriptions. 

In my hubris, I thought this meant that AZ-104 would be easy and straightforward. Haha.
### Resources Used
Over my study experience, I went through the following resources.
- [Microsoft Learn Course](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/courses/az-104t00)
	- While very useful for the purpose of *feeling* like you're learning something, and for familiarizing yourself with the structures and concepts, it was very much mostly a waste of time. The content doesn't really stress the details that matter for the exam, and doesn't go into the level of nuance that's required for passing the exam, and a careful reading of this would not prepare you for the exam.
	- A much more useful method to absorb information on core concepts, services, and structures would be to use a LLM summarizer (like Kagi's in built quick answer) to help understand services and concepts as you come across them.
	- About a week into my study, I was starting to do practice questions, I realized the content wasn't helping me get questions right, and I abandoned this approach
- Udemy course 1
	- I initially started off with this coure, and slowly worked through the question packs. While I won't say the concepts are wrong, or they're not helpful, but they don't prepare you for the level of difficulty of the actual exam.
	- The low quality is reflected by the reviews. 
	- I would say this is likely the worst course, because it lulls you into a false sense of security on your level of preparedness
- Udemy course 2
	- This is the only course that's worth your time. 
- Microsoft Practice Exam
	- Similar, way too easy, while having even worse explanations than _ I'd recommend using it as an indicator for if you should postpone the exam. If you're scoring terribly on the practice exam, (less than 60%), you should consider postponing the exam
	- The only benefit is it allows you to check your answers as you work on the questions. 

### Study Methods
### Exam Experience

There's a forced split in the exam. I would suggest leaving yourself roughly 10 minutes to work on the last section. I think it can safely be completed under 5 minutes, but I don't think you want to subject yourself to the spiritual danger of dashing through 5 questions that rely on careful review of multiple pages of context.

There are scenario questions which cannot be revisited/reviewed after, for some reason. Who knows why. 




You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
