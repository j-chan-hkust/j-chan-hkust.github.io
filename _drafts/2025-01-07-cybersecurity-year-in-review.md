### CrowdStrike
Crowdstrike does kernel level antivirus scanning. This level of privilege means if they make a mistake, it can brick a machine. Essentially that's what happened, a bad update bricked machines. This bad update happened due to bad devops, essentially.

The ultimate fix required super user level of understanding:
- Boot Windows into Safe Mode or WRE
- Navigate to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike`
- Delete the faulty file matching "C-00000291*.sys"

Which is what caused the issue to persist for so long. (note many users don't have the ability/permissions to do this! So company IT had to untangle this, for every user!)

### Salt Typhoon
For the last 2 years, chinese hackers have been infiltrating **network infrastructure devices** of US telecoms. This means they could listen in to convos. Pretty bad. Precise details not released.

### Solar Winds
Supply chain attack of the company back in 2020. Pretty damn bad!

# Core Trends
- Phishing on the rise - likely will continue to rise due to LLM activity
- The biggest risk is always human error: Especially now with AI it's getting worse. Really well crafted phishing emails, deep fakes, impersonation.
- Quantum just hit a milestone with Willow - but it's still not a production viable thing yet.
- Continued activity from nationstate actors
- Crypto has also made transfer of value possible, even to sanctioned countries like NK. This means corporate cyber espionage and ransomware is economically viable, and any company that is worth money will have a target on their back.




	In the case of JS - the data they've cleaned and collected for signal processing is incredibly valuable, so safe storage and maintenance of this data is key. The amount of funds being channeled by the company is also high - meaning its a very high priority for cyber attacks. It's also getting more tied into the management of stock market - so it's gradually going to be a bigger and bigger deal.
