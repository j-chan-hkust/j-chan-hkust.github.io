At the start of the year I happened to be mucking about trying to write blog posts using an LLM. I had gotten it in my head that I wanted to write more, and I was trying — and failing — to keep a writing schedule. I think I was using some version of Claude through Kagi Assistant. I fed it a couple bits of writing as a style guide, I fed it a WhatsApp transcript I had with my partner, and let it rip.

[[hollow-mirror|The result]] felt pretty incredible. In retrospect, it wasn't a piece of grand literature. It made very liberal use of the "it's not A — it's B" structure that everyone recognizes nowadays. But it managed to turn a mediocre idea I had into a mediocre blog post in 2 minutes flat.  

Way better than the 2 hours I usually would do.

If I wanted to, I could start churning out a blog post every day. Trivially, I would start dwarfing my previous output. No more fretting to myself about what to write, no more irregular post schedules. No more drafts stuck in editing hell. With a little bit of copy-editing and clever prompting, I could probably beat the allegations and avoid all the LLM-isms that would give it away.

My partner didn't like it. Not because the writing was bad[^1], but because of what it did to the act of writing itself, and what it did to me. Great, I now have more lottery tickets to throw on HackerNews, more opportunities to "be read". But then what? I keep chasing that dragon of more content and more clout?

I'm not exactly sure what I'm trying to achieve here, writing this. Mostly I just know it's good for me, somehow. A way to be a little less crazy in this information-addled world. A way for me to share my thoughts with my friends and colleagues. A mental touching-of-grass.

Though I'd like to be, I'm not [gwern](https://gwern.net). I'm not [Tim Urban](https://waitbutwhy.com/). I'm not a writer[^3]. I don't have the mental strength to throw post after post into the void of the internet, in the vague hopes of being read and remembered by a bunch of people[^2]. I'm just an engineer who happens to like words. And I'd like to keep writing for the right reasons.

So yeah. That's why this blog isn't written with an LLM. Because I don't need any more ways for me to intensify and productivize my own hobbies.
