I've procrastinated writing this for a very long time. This specific topic has sat in my drafts for more than a year – I started writing[^1] this last year in October – and I have circled around this topic for more than a year, never arriving at a conclusion.

Why is this so hard? I could easily come up with some LinkedIn slop about about opportunities, growth, perseverance, patience, time, wisdom, people, relationships, etc. Such great chances of corporate shillery don't come along often, but I can't make myself do it. Because these 5 years clearly meant something to me, and I'll be damned if I turn it into LinkedIn garbage.

And yet my pride and ego insists we're clever – that we can sculpt something that manages to blend the cynical and the authentic, something that manages to be pristine corporate shilling and also emotionally gratifying. Just give it some time.

Well it's been a year, and I am not clever.

This year I turned 28. I've been working for more than 5 years now. I've been a legal adult for more than 10 years now. In a few more months I'll be 29. What do I have to show for it?

Things are fine. Good even. My job is good. It's comfortable. I'm challenged, enough. I'm no longer worrying constantly about the future and my place in it. It's not just me. My managers are happy with my performance and I get good feedback. I've gotten through multiple corporate restructurings and redundancies, and I've never been close to the chopping block. I'm pretty good at this "being employed" thing.

*But is this really good enough for me?* Mark Zuckerberg was a billionaire at 23. Steve Jobs started apple at 23. Swathes of musicians and artists didn't make it to 28. Scores of mathematicians had finished their contributions and had been buried, at my age. Heck, even pulling away from the people who took high-risk-high-reward maneuvers, there are still so many people who have gone down a better path than me, working in big tech, AI, hedge funds, i-banks, insert-prestigious-job-I happen-to-care-about-here. Everything I have right now is not impressive. It's not special.

And critically, I no longer have a potential future to hide behind anymore. I can't just say "oh that job will come around when I've finished my masters" or "I'll finally get around to developing that startup idea I've been drafting". That potential future became the past last year in January.

This is the deal – 5 years ago I graduated university after doing pretty alright in university. I then went on to do pretty alright in my job, in doing so thoroughly failing my own naive self-conception of myself as something[^2] more than pretty alright. This is the gift of the 5 years.
