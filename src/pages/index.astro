			<p>Hi, I'm Jung. This is my personal page where I write about things I care about every sometimes.</p>
			
			<p>I'm an engineer at <a href="https://www.sc.com/en/about/innovation/sc-ventures/">SC Ventures</a>, where I mainly work on the tech teams platform operations<sup>1</sup>, while also occasionally wearing other hats<sup>2</sup>, as is normal for a relatively small team like ours. I've always struggled to summarize it in a single well defined job description — maybe reach out to me and I can give a more in depth explanation.</p>
			
			<p>These days, I'm mostly working with AWS, Terraform, Python; but LLMs like Claude are helping me expand into other technologies.</p>
			
			<p>In a past life, I was a semi-professional inline speed skater, though I've recently retired in a relatively common fashion — slowly, then all at once — due to the pressures of my career, and then an international move from HK to SG.</p>
			
			<p>Now my free time is mostly spent on climbing<sup>3</sup>, something I've gradually learned how to pursue with a casual seriousness.</p>

			<p><sup>2</sup> Operations, project management, security</p>
			<p><sup>3</sup> Just not trad!</p>
