# In Short
- The exam is really easy. No, really. My preparation was essentially:
	- Doing one practice exam from udemy https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-associate-practice-exam
	- Reading through our organizations terraform code usage
	- Asking relevant questions to an LLM with a well defined prompt
	- Creating notes in obsidian
- My whole preparation, from 0-100, took less than a week.
- The hardest part of the exam was the online proctoring system - getting your exam paused for looking away from the screen, getting distracted by a phone notification, worrying if your roommate walking out to use the bathroom is going to make you fail the exam - all these collectively was a lot more pressure.

While awareness of cloud providers is necessary to understand why IaC is valuable, it's not much more depth than an "AWS Cloud Practitioner" level of understanding - i.e. you just need to understand what cloud is and the benefits.

I do think the exam deserves to be a little more difficult to convey some more meaning. It definitely felt a little trivial to obtain.
