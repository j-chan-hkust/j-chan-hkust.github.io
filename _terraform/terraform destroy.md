The `terraform destroy` command is used to terminate and remove all resources that were created and managed by your Terraform configuration. This will remove all resources that are tracked in your Terraform state file (or all the resources that are defined in your repo).

Some nuanced ways to use it:
- use the `prevent_destroy` lifecycle configuration to protect certain resources 
- use the `-target` flag to destroy specific resources instead of everything
- run a `terraform state rm` command to remove the resource from Terraform management before running the `terraform destroy` command
